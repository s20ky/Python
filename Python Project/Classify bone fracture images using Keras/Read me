🦴 Bone Fracture Classification using Keras

This repository contains a deep learning project for classifying bone fracture images using Keras. The goal is to build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can automatically detect whether a bone is fractured or not from medical images.

📂 Repository Contents

🚀 Getting Started
1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bone-fracture-classification.git
cd bone-fracture-classification

2️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Run the notebook

Open Jupyter Notebook and run:

jupyter notebook "Classify bone fracture images using Keras.ipynb"

📊 Model Workflow

Data Preprocessing – Load bone X-ray images, normalize pixel values, and augment training data.

Model Building – Define a CNN architecture in Keras.

Training & Validation – Train the model on fracture vs. normal bone datasets.

Evaluation – Plot training history, confusion matrix, and classification reports.

Prediction – Test the model on unseen images.
