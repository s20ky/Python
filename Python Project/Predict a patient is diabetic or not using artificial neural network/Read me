üß† Predict Diabetes using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict whether a patient is diabetic or not based on medical diagnostic data.

üìå Project Overview

The goal of this project is to apply Deep Learning techniques to a real-world health dataset and classify patients as diabetic or non-diabetic.
Key highlights:

Preprocessing the dataset (handling missing values, normalization, feature scaling).

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

Building an ANN model using TensorFlow/Keras.

Training and evaluating the model on unseen data.

Achieving a balance between accuracy and generalization.

üìä Dataset

The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which contains medical details of female patients of Pima Indian heritage, aged 21 and above.

Number of features: 8

Target variable: 1 (Diabetic) or 0 (Non-Diabetic)

Features include:

Pregnancies

Glucose level

Blood Pressure

Skin Thickness

Insulin

BMI

Diabetes Pedigree Function

Age
