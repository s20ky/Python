🧬 Patient Segmentation using Gene Expression Data

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on clustering patients based on gene expression data. The main goal is to identify meaningful subgroups of patients that may share similar genetic profiles, which can help in understanding diseases, personalized treatments, and biomedical research.
