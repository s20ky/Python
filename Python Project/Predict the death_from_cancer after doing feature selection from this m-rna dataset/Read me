üß¨ Predict Cancer Patient Survival using Feature Selection & Machine Learning

This repository includes a Jupyter Notebook that predicts whether a patient will die from cancer or survive, based on mRNA expression data after applying feature selection techniques.

üìå Project Overview

The goal is to leverage bioinformatics and machine learning to improve predictions of cancer survival outcomes. High-dimensional mRNA datasets often contain thousands of features, so feature selection is critical to reduce dimensionality and improve model accuracy.

Key objectives:

Perform feature selection to identify the most relevant genes.

Train and evaluate machine learning models for survival prediction.

Compare performance across different models.

üìä Dataset

Type: mRNA expression dataset.

Features: Thousands of gene expression levels.

Target variable: death_from_cancer (Yes = 1, No = 0).

‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values.

Normalize gene expression levels.

Feature Selection

Apply statistical and machine learning-based feature selection methods.

Reduce dataset dimensionality to most significant features.

Model Building

Train ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, ANN, etc.).

Hyperparameter tuning for performance optimization.

Evaluation

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.

ROC-AUC curve.
